        <p>The Great White Shark</p>
        <p>Great white sharks are the top of the ocean‚Äôs food chain. They are the biggest fish on our planet which eat other fish and animals. They are known to live between thirty and one hundred years old and can be found in all of the world‚Äôs oceans, but they are mostly found in cool water close to the coast.</p>
        <p>Even though they are mostly grey, they get their name from their white underbelly. The great white shark has been known to grow up to six metres long and have up to three hundred sharp teeth, in seven rows. Their amazing sense of smell allows them to hunt for prey, such as seals, rays and small whales from miles away.</p>
